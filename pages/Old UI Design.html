      <h1>Old UI Design</h1>
      <p>The negatives of bad UI design include:</p>
      <p>Poor User Experience: Bad UI design can lead to a poor user experience, which can make it difficult or frustrating for users to accomplish tasks, navigate through an interface, or use a product. This can result in users abandoning the product or seeking alternative solutions.</p>
      <p>Reduced Productivity: Poor UI design can also reduce productivity, as users may take longer to complete tasks or may need to constantly refer to user manuals or help documentation. This can be a major hindrance to businesses that rely on efficient and productive workflows.</p>
